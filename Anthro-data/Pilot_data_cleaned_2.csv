7,I consent to partcipating in the study,Male,26,1,7,4,"Since I dont know anything about the controll mechanism behind the robot I dont think I can fairly judge that in any way and therefore gave the same answer for all. Furthermore even if I knew, I dont see a correlation between predictability and ones ability to controll a robot, since it all comes down to programming their behaviour. If we start talking about AI that would look different I guess, but thats a theme way to heavy for a wednesday morning. Also, maybe I'm just too dumb for that."
