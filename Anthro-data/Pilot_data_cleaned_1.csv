1,I consent to partcipating in the study,Non-binary,32,1,6,2,"I would say 2 and 4 seemed hard to control, but if the controller was going for robotic ballroom dancing I feel they hit the mark pretty well. The difficulty of control I feel would come down to the complexity of the controls and the skills of the one controlling it. 
I set it as closer to difficult as I have little to know intimate knowledge of code or tech so for me personally I would probably struggle more than someone more apt in the field. "
